Mahesh lad application

i have completed all of the tasks in one application


my set up
using the first 1000 hotspots
using the first 10000 real time locations
displaying first 30 seconds of real time locations

performence considerations
you need to consider how you center the map each time your refresh
you need to consider how may hot spots to load.

for a better experience, it  may be  better to only  use data with a certain distance from the user location
from a webservice.
It would be better to load data into core data then only fetch that real time data for a timestamp.
